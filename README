For actual example test classes using SipUnit, see the java files in the
	examples/java/org/cafesip/sipunit/test/* directories. You can run the noproxy/TestNoProxy
	test right away as long as sipunit/examples/java and the jar files from 
	sipunit/lib are in the classpath (more on running the test classes below). 
	For running some of the other test classes, a proxy or stun server is required. For setup info,
	see the header comments in each test java file and also visit 
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#Proxy_Considerations.
	
TO RUN AN EXAMPLE TEST: see how at
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#mozTocId89601

To debug what's happening during a SipUnit test, turn on the SipUnit trace by adding
    this line of code to your test class setUp() method after creating the SipStack:
         SipStack.setTraceEnabled(true);
          
    You can also set the trace level to 32 instead of the default 16 to get even more output. Do it by setting the
    following property in the properties provided to SipStack creation: 
        properties.setProperty("gov.nist.javax.sip.TRACE_LEVEL", "32");
    
    Also you can use the NIST-SIP visual trace tool. See how, and get it, here:
